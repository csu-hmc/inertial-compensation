Task list for Rutwick's masters research project.

1. Report on the design of force-torque sensor
2. Learn D-Flow
3. Learn how to run Sandy's inertial compensation code and determine the amount of compensation.
4. Learn how to collect data from the treadmill and accelerometers with D-Flow
5. Determine the time lag between accelerometers and force plate data.  Try a sequence of lag values and
see which one gives the lowest RMS residual
6. Determine resolution and noise of the accelerometer.  We need about 0.04 m/s2 accuracy to have a final error of 6 N in the force.
7. Collect data with the test protocol. Do the seven tests on one day, process the data, if it looks good, do it again on another day
   and see if results are the same.  If not, change protocol or methods.

belts off, random pitch-sway (this is used to calibrate the model, determine the A matrix)
belts off, pitch-sway off
belts on, pitch-sway off
belts on, random pitch-sway
belts off, pitch-sway off, jumping on the floor to create vibration
belts on, pitch-sway off, walking on belt 1 while collecting data from belt 2
belts on, random pitch-sway, walking on belt 1 while collecting data from belt 2

8 Results to report from each test condition.  RMS of the 6 forceplate signals before and after compensation.  Effect of low-
pass filtering on RMS.  RMS at 6 Hz, in a Table comparing day 1 and day 2.  Do everything only for force plate 2.

9. Write report.
